## Project Description

Welcome to my API Fetching JavaScript App! This simple application demonstrates my skills in JavaScript and API integration, specifically in fetching and displaying things like weather data, or stock data.

## Features

- **Current Weather Display**: Fetches and displays the current weather for the entered city.
- **Stock data**: Fetches and displays different stock data of your choosing.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work seamlessly across various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The primary language used for the application logic.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the user interface.
- **Node.js**: For running the application server locally.
- **Express.js**: Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used for handling routes and requests.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For fetching weather data based on the provided city name.
- **Polygon.io API**: For fetching stock data based on user input.
